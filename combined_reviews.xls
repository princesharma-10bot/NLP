caff75f0-561a-4c08-a8ca-42013fcfbdfb,"Route algorithm on this app is good. It gives you the most optimal routes in an urban environment, which is great for commuting. However (strike 1), the app has a tendency of redirecting you in very small residential streets which is annoying to drive thru as a driver as you keep having to take turns everywhere. Not only that, it disturbs the peace of a lot of unfortunate people that have to live there. The reason I do not recommend this app outside urban environment is because the app sometimes is unable to find correct routes in the country side. It sometimes makes you take routes that are 30min to an hour longer than some other routes which is quite frankly not acceptable (this happened multiple times and only found out by using Google maps that it was in fact much faster to use another route). The last point is that the app is not battery friendly whatsoever. I have measured manually how much power it was using and the app is using a lot more power than it displays. I'm talking around 20 percent battery for a 45min drive which is way overkill. Other navigation apps do not use this to that extent, so I'm not sure what Waze is running in the background to use that much power. Aside from all those issues, all of the small additions like accident reporting and police reports are extremely useful. If a user is using solely for that purpose, then the app is very good at doing that. Otherwise, would not really recommend this app unless you are a proactive driver who's actively trying to optimizing your commute.",3,Waze Navigation & Live Traffic

The crowd-sourced contributions of data users of Google Maps contributes to the service allows for this app to make intelligent decisions to get us to or destinations quickly and safely. The location accuracy still has issues at times, and this has been over the course of using the app for more than five years on a variety of devices by different manufacturers, including tablets that have mobile signals (such devices were set to highest accuracy mode using GPS and Wi-Fi). For insurance, I could be driving on a service road 100 feet parallel to a highway and the app will think I'm on the highway, or vice versa. Also, you can end up driving a quarter of a mile before the app will recognize you've missed a turn and begin to reroute your trip. Finally, the app creates contact entries in your phone when you synced to your contacts, which creates unnecessary contact clutter (and getting duplicates of when half of my battle 8,000 contacts because they have made a Waze account at some point in their Life can be quite annoying, especially if it contains outdated info!).",4,Waze Navigation & Live Traffic

As you drive, and accumulate points... You gain status in this app, and get more feature-rich access. ------------------ The downside...  ((1)) The app does not explain at any point in time, nor does it even offer a pop up, explaining that people should not mark police cars on the map, if they are traveling... That doesn't do anyone else behind you any good. There should be instructions or a pop-up, that explain to only mark police officers that are stopped on the side of the road. You would think everybody would know this, but unfortunately as the society progresses, the IQ drops. LOL...... ((2)) As I indicated initially, I used this app for the better part of two years... However, (back in 2015) it would eat my battery alive. A 50 mile trip in heavy traffic, say 2+ hours, and phone would die... EVEN WHEN CHARGING the app would kill my phone. ------------------- I am re downloading this app to a newer phone now. Hoping that items ((1)) and ((2)) above have been addressed by the app makers.

A usabilidade do app me Ã© mais prazerosa do que a do Google Maps. Uma oportunidade de melhora Ã© deixar mais fÃ¡cil de avisar o app que nÃ£o preciso mais das direÃ§Ãµes ao fim do trajeto, por exemplo, porque o som ao virar na rua ""errada"" Ã© irritante, e desligar o app requer insistÃªncia nos cliques e demora a responder.",5,Waze Navigation & Live Traffic

It's absolute nonsense to not have navigation with the screen off. edit 2020: seems to be working now, not sure whether the problem was with waze itself or with my OS",5,Waze Navigation & Live Traffic
ec419fda-16f3-49e8-bca4-fde49632d645,I love it does aware you of accidents stopped semi's on the side of the road and of officers for those who have a led foot behind the wheel I advise all to get it sometimes it says police nearby and you won't see any but thays either because they moved soon after or are in everyone's blind side be cautious and get this app I love it works great !!!!,5,Waze Navigation & Live Traffic
